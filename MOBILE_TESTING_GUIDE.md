## What Was Fixed
✅ **Touch Device Access**: Removed the touch device warning - the app now works on mobile  
✅ **Touch Interactions**: Added touch event handlers to all interactive elements  
✅ **Responsive UI**: Mobile-optimized toolbar and layout  
✅ **Touch Gestures**: Pinch-to-zoom and touch drag support  
✅ **Larger Touch Targets**: Increased corner sizes for easier tapping  
✅ **Touch Instructions**: First-time user help modal  

## Testing Steps

### 1. Access the App
- Open `http://localhost:3002` in a mobile browser
- Or use Chrome DevTools Device Simulation (F12 → Toggle Device Toolbar)

### 2. Test Core Interactions
- **Tap walls**: Should select and show edit options
- **Tap corners**: Should select corner points for editing  
- **Tap surfaces**: Should select surface areas
- **Drag elements**: Should move walls and corners
- **Pinch-to-zoom**: Should zoom in/out on the canvas
- **Toolbar taps**: Should switch between tools

### 3. Test Specific Features
- **Wall editing**: Tap a wall, try moving endpoints
- **Corner editing**: Tap corner points, drag to move
- **Surface patterns**: Tap surfaces, try pattern editor
- **Tool switching**: Use toolbar buttons to switch modes

### 4. What Should Work Now
- All interactive elements respond to touch
- No more "touch device not supported" message
- Mobile-friendly UI with appropriate sizing
- Smooth pinch-to-zoom navigation
- Touch drag for moving elements

## Previous Issues That Should Be Fixed

## Report Issues
If any interactions still don't work on touch devices, please specify:
1. Device type (iOS/Android/Browser simulation)
2. Specific interaction that fails
3. Expected vs actual behavior
