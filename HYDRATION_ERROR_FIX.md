# Hydration Error Fix

## Problem
The application was showing a hydration error in the console:
```
In HTML, <html> cannot be a child of <body>.
This will cause a hydration error.
```

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by nested `<html>` tags in the layout structure:

1. **Root Layout** (`/src/app/layout.tsx`) was creating an `<html>` tag
2. **Language Layout** (`/src/app/[lang]/layout.tsx`) was also creating another `<html>` tag inside the first one

This created invalid HTML structure: `<html><body><html>...</html></body></html>`

## Solution
Restructured the layout hierarchy to eliminate nested HTML tags:

### 1. Root Layout (`/src/app/layout.tsx`)
- **Keeps**: `<html>` and `<body>` tags with proper structure
- **Handles**: Global styles, fonts, analytics, and basic HTML structure
- **Language**: Set to "en" as default

### 2. Language Layout (`/src/app/[lang]/layout.tsx`)
- **Removed**: `<html>` and `<body>` tags (no longer creates HTML structure)
- **Removed**: Unused font imports and variables
- **Keeps**: Only the `I18nProvider` wrapper for language-specific functionality
- **Purpose**: Provides language context to child components

### 3. Updated Structure
```
<html lang="en"> (from root layout)
  <body> (from root layout)
    <I18nProvider initialLanguage={lang}> (from language layout)
      {children} (page content)
    </I18nProvider>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Files Changed

### `/src/app/[lang]/layout.tsx`
- Removed `<html>` and `<body>` tags
- Removed font imports (`Geist`, `Geist_Mono`) 
- Removed CSS import (handled by root layout)
- Simplified to only provide `I18nProvider` wrapper

## Result
- ✅ No more hydration errors
- ✅ Both root path (`/`) and language-specific paths (`/en`, `/pl`) work correctly
- ✅ Proper HTML structure maintained
- ✅ Language functionality preserved
- ✅ SEO-friendly routing maintained

## Testing
- Development server compiles successfully
- No console errors
- Both `http://localhost:3000/` and `http://localhost:3000/pl` return 200 status
- Language switching works correctly
