# Texture Loading Debug Guide

## Testing the Texture Loading Fix

To test if the texture loading from browser storage works correctly, follow these steps:

### 1. Create a Project with Textures
1. Open the planner at `http://localhost:3001/en/planner`
2. Add some tiles to the pattern
3. Upload custom textures and apply them to tiles
4. Click "Save to Browser" 

### 2. Test Loading
1. Refresh the page (F5 or Cmd/Ctrl+R)
2. Check if textures are properly restored
3. Open browser console to see debug logs

### 3. Expected Behavior
- Console should show texture loading logs
- Textures should appear in the texture library
- Tiles should have their textures properly applied
- No broken texture references

### 4. Debug Information
Check console for:
- "Loading textures from browser storage: X textures found"
- "Adding textures from project: X textures"
- "Current texture library size: X"
- "Adding new texture: old-id -> new-id"
- "Updating surface with new texture IDs"

### 5. Common Issues
- If textures are loaded but not applied: ID mapping issue
- If textures aren't loaded: localStorage data structure issue
- If console shows errors: Check texture data integrity

### 6. Verification
- Tiles should show their textures immediately after page load
- Texture library should contain the textures
- No broken texture references should appear
