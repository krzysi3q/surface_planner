I build web applications using TypeScript, React, and Next.js. Use functional components and modern syntax. Code should be concise and clean, with minimal or no comments. Follow Next.js conventions and assume core-web-vitals and TypeScript configurations are enabled. Avoid unnecessary abstractions or verbose patterns.

Prefer using the "react-konva" library when working with canvas-like interactions. Don't suggest class components or overly complex state management unless necessary.
