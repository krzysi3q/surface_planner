# Language Routing Changes - SEO Optimization

## Problem
The original implementation redirected users from the root path (`/`) to language-specific URLs (e.g., `/en`), which caused SEO problems due to unnecessary redirects.

## Solution
Implemented a new approach where:

1. **Root path serves content directly** - No redirects from `/` for better SEO
2. **Browser language detection** - Content on root path uses browser-detected language
3. **Explicit language choice** - When users choose a language, they're navigated to language-specific URLs

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Shared Component `/src/components/HomePage.tsx`
- Extracted all homepage content into a reusable component
- Eliminates code duplication between root and language-specific pages
- Contains all sections: Hero, Features, How It Works, and CTA

### 2. Updated `/src/app/page.tsx`
- Simplified to use shared `HomePage` component
- Wrapped with `I18nProvider` for browser language detection
- Serves content directly without redirects

### 3. Updated `/src/app/[lang]/page.tsx`
- Simplified to use shared `HomePage` component
- Uses language from URL parameter via layout's `I18nProvider`

### 4. Updated `/src/middleware.ts`
- Modified to allow root path (`/`) to be served without redirect
- Only redirects non-root paths that don't have language prefixes

### 5. Updated `/src/app/layout.tsx`
- Added proper HTML structure with metadata
- Included Cloudflare analytics and font configurations

### 6. Updated `/src/components/SmartPlannerLink.tsx`
- Enhanced to handle both root-level and language-prefixed routing
- Maintains SEO-friendly behavior while supporting language switching

### 7. Updated `/src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx`
- Improved to handle root-level language switching
- Redirects to language-specific URLs when language is explicitly chosen

## Benefits

1. **Better SEO** - No unnecessary redirects from root path
2. **User Experience** - Automatic language detection for first-time visitors
3. **Language Flexibility** - Users can still access language-specific URLs
4. **Code Maintainability** - Single source of truth for homepage content
5. **Backward Compatibility** - All existing language-specific URLs continue to work

## Behavior

- **First visit to `/`**: Shows content in browser-detected language without redirect
- **Language switching**: Navigates to language-specific URL (e.g., `/en`, `/pl`)
- **Direct language URLs**: Continue to work as before (`/en`, `/pl/planner`, etc.)
- **Search engines**: Index root path without redirect loops

## Refactoring Summary

- **Before**: Duplicate homepage content in two files
- **After**: Single shared `HomePage` component used by both pages
- **Lines of code**: Reduced from ~480 lines to ~15 lines (plus 1 shared component)
- **Maintainability**: Changes to homepage now only need to be made in one place
